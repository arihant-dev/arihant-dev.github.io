                            Recently, I've been diving deep into distributed systems and came across the fascinating concept of Map Reduce. 
                            It's a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

                        <p>
                            Inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Billion Row Challenge</a> hosted on GitHub, 
                            I decided to implement a simplified version of Map Reduce for a side project. The goal was to process a massive dataset efficiently by splitting the work across multiple nodes (Map phase) and then aggregating the results (Reduce phase).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My understanding was greatly enhanced by the <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems Lecture 1</a> and the Map Reduce paper by Jeffrey and Sanjay, which provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for such algorithms.
                            Implementing this gave me hands-on experience with data partitioning, shuffling, and handling node failures in a distributed environment.
